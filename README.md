# fiberdyne
A set of C++ routines to create concurrent network applications
Really fiberdyne is a bunch of C++ code that I developed and don't want to lose the the vagueries of an OS reinstall, or lost hard disk.

If you are an explorer of writing networking code on Windows, you might find some useful gems in here.
